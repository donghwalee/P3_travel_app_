# Project Three - Group Full-Stack Application
- Andrew Freeman, John Kim, Tendai Chiriga, and Donghwa Lee

## This project implements the following technologies:
- HTML & CSS
- Javascript & jQuery
- Ruby on Rails, Angular, Postgres, ActiveRecord
- bcrypt, ngMap
- heroku
- Google fonts

## Required and optional features included in this Project:
**Required**
- Used Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, and Angular.
- Used Rails as an API with 3 related models, including a user model. The 3 models are users, trips, and comments
- Adhered to RESTful routing conventions whenever they apply.
- Used Angular as the front end of your application.
- Added authentication to the application, without a pre-built library using bcrypt.
- Styling
- API documentation
- Git and Gitub usage

**Advanced - Implemented**
- Incorporated Google Maps API using ngMap
- Used several libraries for functionalities and styling within the site

**Advanced - Not implemented**
- Usage of oAuth logins to allow users to access data from other services
- Complete and document another type of testing (e.g. user acceptance testing)

## Simplified flow for app:
- User logs in / registers
- Once logged in, users can see their past trips
- User can create, edit, comment on, and delete their trips. The trips details as well as the location of the trips, on a map, are visible
- User can log out when finished
- For detailed user stories, please see:

## How the app was coded

### Ruby on Rails:
- **models, controllers, and routing**
- users, session, trips, comments, and tags (unutilized)

### Postgres:
- **database to store data for the app**

### Angular:
- **view / single page app**

### External API (Google Maps):
- **ngMap**

## Unsolved Problems:
**Advanced - Not implemented**
- Usage of oAuth logins to allow users to access data from other services
- Complete and document another type of testing (e.g. user acceptance testing)

**Other features that we would like to implement**
- Ability for one to see and comment on other people's trips.
- Ability to upload related photos for each trip
- Use of tags and to be able to sort / search / view by tags, etc.
- Mobile friendly
- User preferences and account management. More icon options and ability for one to choose
- Varying levels of user rights
- Send invitations to join
- Notifications (when somebody posts on your topic, replies to your comments, mentions you, etc.)
- Private and public trips
- Better coding/organization/optimization
- Better error handling
